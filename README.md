# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Prophet

## Aims
The aim of the "Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Prophet" project is to develop a reliable and user-friendly framework for predicting the stock prices of Netflix (NFLX) using Facebook's Prophet forecasting tool. \
The project seeks to demonstrate how time series analysis and forecasting can be applied to financial data, providing insights and predictions that can aid in investment decisions.

## Objectives
The objectives of this project include importing historical stock price data of Netflix and exploring the structure and key statistics of the dataset. This is followed by visualizing historical stock price trends and volumes using Plotly to create clear and informative plots that highlight data patterns and trends. The data is then preprocessed by renaming columns and selecting relevant features to prepare it for analysis. \
The project involves developing a Prophet forecasting model, which is trained on historical stock price data to understand trends and seasonality. Using the trained model, future stock price predictions are generated and visualized, along with the model components to understand contributing factors. 
Finally, the forecasted data is exported for further analysis or use in other applications.

## Summary
The "Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Prophet" project leverages Facebook's Prophet, a robust time series forecasting tool, to predict the future stock prices of Netflix (NFLX). The project involves importing and exploring historical stock price data, visualizing trends using Plotly, and preparing the data for analysis. By applying the Prophet model, the project demonstrates how to train a forecasting model, generate future predictions, and visualize the results. The forecasted data is then exported for further use. \
This project provides a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in applying time series forecasting to financial data, with a focus on simplicity and accuracy.
