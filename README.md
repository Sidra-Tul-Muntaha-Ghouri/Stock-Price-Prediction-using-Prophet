# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Prophet

## Description
This project leverages Facebook's Prophet forecasting tool to predict the future stock prices of Netflix (NFLX). It demonstrates how time series analysis and forecasting can be applied to financial data, providing insights and predictions that can aid in investment decisions.

## Aims
The aim of the "Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Prophet" project is to develop a reliable and user-friendly framework for predicting Netflix's stock prices using Prophet.

## Objectives
- **Data Importation and Exploration**: Import historical stock price data of Netflix and explore the structure and key statistics of the dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize historical stock price trends and volumes using Plotly to create clear and informative plots that highlight data patterns and trends.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the stock price data for analysis by renaming columns and selecting relevant features.
- **Model Development**: Implement the Prophet forecasting model and train it on historical stock price data to understand trends and seasonality.
- **Forecasting**: Generate future stock price predictions using the trained Prophet model and visualize the forecasted prices and the model components to understand contributing factors.
- **Results Exportation**: Export the forecasted data for further analysis or use in other applications.

## Summary
The project involves importing and exploring historical stock price data, visualizing trends using Plotly, and preparing the data for analysis. The Prophet model is then applied to train on historical stock price data, generating future predictions. These predictions are visualized and the forecasted data is exported for further use.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, plotly, prophet

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sidra-Tul-Muntaha-Ghouri/Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Prophet
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Prophet
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas plotly prophet
    ```

## Usage
1. Ensure your runtime is set to GPU for faster computation.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to import the dataset, visualize the data, and perform forecasting.
3. Export the forecasted results for further analysis.

## Features
- Import and explore historical stock price data.
- Visualize stock price trends and volumes.
- Train and apply a Prophet forecasting model.
- Generate and visualize future stock price predictions.
- Export forecasted data.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is historical stock price data for Netflix (NFLX), which includes columns like Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume.

## Model Development
The Prophet model is implemented and trained on historical stock price data to understand trends and seasonality. This involves preparing the data, fitting the model, and making future predictions.

## Visualization
Plotly is used to visualize historical stock prices and volumes. The forecasted prices and model components are also visualized to provide insights into the data and predictions.

## Forecasting
The trained Prophet model generates future stock price predictions, which are visualized to understand the predicted trends and contributing factors.

## Results
The forecasted data is summarized and visualized, providing a comprehensive overview of the model's predictions.

## Export
The forecasted data is exported to a CSV file for further analysis or use in other applications.
